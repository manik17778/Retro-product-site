   - &nbsp; OUR MISSION &nbsp;-
  </p>
  <p>
    "Our team comprises passionate professionals with expertise in their fields"
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>As the proud legacy of Polaroid, </b> we are a renowned American company that has left an indelible mark on the world of instant photography. Founded in 1937 by our visionary founder, Edwin H. Land, we set out on a mission to explore the endless possibilities of his revolutionary Polaroid polarizing polymer.

In 1948, we achieved a groundbreaking milestone by introducing the world's first instant camera, the iconic Land Camera. This innovative invention changed the way people captured and cherished their memories forever.

<br> <br> Throughout our illustrious journey, we have thrived under the leadership of <b> Edwin H. Land  </b> 1981. At the peak of our success, we employed over 21,000 talented individuals in 1978, and our revenue reached an incredible $3 billion in 1991.

While we faced challenges in the early 2000s and were declared bankrupt in 2001, we emerged stronger than ever before. Our brand and assets found new homes, eventually leading to their acquisition by the visionary Polish billionaire in 2017.

<br> <br>Under this new ownership, we experienced a renaissance. The Impossible Project, a company that had been producing instant films for our classic Polaroid cameras since 2008, was given the opportunity to embrace our cherished legacy. In 2017, they proudly rebounded themselves as Polaroid Originals, continuing our tradition of excellence.

And finally, in 2020, Polaroid Originals accomplished the remarkable feat of restoring our iconic name to its rightful place, reintroducing us as simply <b>"Polaroid."</b> Today, we stand strong, keeping the spirit of instant photography alive and celebrating the joy of capturing moments in an instant.

 As Polaroid, we remain committed to innovation, creativity, and the magic of instant photography. We take pride in our storied history, and with each new day, we continue to create unforgettable memories for generations to come. Welcome to the world of Polaroid cameras - where every moment is captured in an instant, forever imprinted in time.<br>
  

 <br> <b>In 2001 Polaroid filed for bankruptcy protection</b>, the result of what many believed was the failure of the company to fully embrace digital technology. In less than a year, most of the corporation’s assets and those of its subsidiaries had been sold to OEP Imaging Corporation, creating a new company, Primary PDC, Inc., which continued to operate as Polaroid Corporation; OEP Imaging Corporation subsequently became Polaroid Holding Company (PHC). In 2005 PHC was purchased by Petters Group Worldwide. Polaroid remained under bankruptcy protection until 2006. Although it had no employees or business operations during that time, the brand name continued to be used to license and market various foreign-made electronics. By 2007, however, the company had stopped making cameras altogether. In 2008 Polaroid announced that it would permanently cease production of instant film by early 2009. Later in 2008, Polaroid’s parent company, Petters Group, filed for bankruptcy protection, though Polaroid continued to manufacture and market new products.
